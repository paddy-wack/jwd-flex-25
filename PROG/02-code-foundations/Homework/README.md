# PROG 2 - Code Foundations

Participants will go through an overview of the main applications of programming: computer science, and web development.

## Behavioral Skills & Mindsets Connections

***Future Orientation*** is an important mindset as you grow your skill set as a software developer because coding is a complex skill and learning the building blocks now will set you up for success in the future

***Orientation to Detail*** is important to learn programming because code needs to be precise and thoughtful. Maintaining focus until code is finished & paying attention to errors is valuable for any developer

## Performance Goals Connections

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
