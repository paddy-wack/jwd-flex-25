# JS-5 - Building Interactive Websites with DOM Manipulation

Participants will learn how to combine concepts learned in previous lessons - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - to make exciting   interactive websites, by manipulating DOM.

## Behavioral Skills & Mindsets Connections

***Personal Responsibility*** is important to learn about building interactive websites because it requires working with other developers, or even combining different parts of your own work. Personal responsibility is key to succeed at any website development project, and at being accountable for errors in your code.

***Teamwork*** is important to learn about building interactive websites because you will work in a team combining different technologies and different parts of a project. It's usual that a team of developers divide the development of different parts of a project.

## Performance Goals Connections

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
