# JS 2 - JavaScript Functions, Scope, Program Flow, and Arrays

Participants will learn how to use functions, scopes, arrays, and loops. In Functions they will learn about JavaScript function syntax, passing data to functions, the return keyword, ES6 arrow functions, and concise body syntax. In scopes they will learn about global and block level scope in JavaScript. In arrays they will learn this data structure in JavaScript used to store lists of data. In loops they will learn how to use for and while loops to execute blocks of code multiple times.

## Behavioral Skills & Mindsets Connections

***Persistence***  is important to learn the fundamental concepts of a programming language because there are many new concepts introduced both in logic and syntax, which are challenging. It's important to work hard to master these concepts, which will be used for most tasks looking forward.

***Proactiveness***  is important to learn the fundamental concepts of a programming language because all coding tasks can be solved in many different ways. It's the developers job to own the task, analyze the different options, and create their own way of solving it.

## Performance Goals Connections

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
