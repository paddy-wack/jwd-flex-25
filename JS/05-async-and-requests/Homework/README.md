# JS-4 - Asynchronous JavaScript and Requests

Participants will learn how to write asynchronous JavaScript with the Promises Syntax, how to leverage promises in JavaScript, and will learn the benefits of asynchronous JavaScript properties. They will create calls to various APIs using four different techniques.

## Behavioral Skills & Mindsets Connections

***Growth Mindset*** is important to learn about Asynchronous programming because it means a big change in perspective for a junior developer. Learning a new mental model requires abandoning a fixed mindset, and being ready to improve over time.

***Orientation to Detail*** is important to learn about asynchronous programming because handling requests and promises can create many execution errors that sometimes are not even in the syntax, requiring great debugging skills and a detail oriented behavior.

## Performance Goals Connections

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
